                <p class="bio">
                    Congressman Jim Cooper was born and raised in Tennessee. He and Martha, his wife of twenty eight
                    years,
                    live in Nashville and have three children.

                    A New York Times columnist recently called him "the House's conscience, a lonely voice for civility
                    in
                    this ugly era" and a "tart-tongued moderate" who "seeks bipartisanship on fiscal matters and other
                    issues in a polarized political climate." USA Today named him one of the "Brave 38" of a "tiny band
                    of
                    heroes" in Congress for his work on a bipartisan budget plan.

                    In Congress, he's known for his work on the federal budget, health care and government reform.
